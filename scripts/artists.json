      "detailed_bio": "The Welcoming is an Asheville rock/metal hybrid project that blurs the line between melodic rock, progressive metal, and atmospheric alternative. Originally the solo vision of James Ferrell, the band has evolved into a full live unit crafting songs packed with technical precision, emotional urgency, and massive vocal hooks. With influences ranging from Thrice and Cave In to A Perfect Circle, The Welcoming delivers dynamic, cinematic rock and metal built for fans who want riffs and melody in equal measure."
