# @asheville-music-chart/web

This package will host the refactored web presentation layer. During the transition it can
coexist with the legacy static assets at the repository root.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` – compiles the TypeScript sources.
- `npm run lint` – runs the shared ESLint configuration against local files.
- `npm run test` – executes the workspace Vitest suite.
